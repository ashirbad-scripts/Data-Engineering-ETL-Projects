# Data Engineering ETL Projects

This repository serves as a centralized index of my Data Engineering ETL projects. Each project listed below focuses on real-world data extraction, transformation, and loading workflows using modern tools and best practices. The purpose of this repository is to provide quick access to individual projects without needing to search across multiple repositories.

## Project Index

### 1. [CO2 Emissions By Countries ETL Pipeline](https://github.com/ashirbad-scripts/Data-Engineering-ETL-Projects/tree/main/Pipelines%20%26%20Projects/co2_emission_country)

Extracts CO2 emissions data from raw source files, performs cleaning and transformation, and prepares structured data for analysis and storage. The pipeline focuses on handling real-world messy datasets and making them analysis-ready.
